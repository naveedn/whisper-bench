And that vandals come for these shrines like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past.  Very well, sentinel shrine, the farthest shrine is going out.

Just like every other time they've sent me out I'll keep coming back one way or another.  Keep your feet on the ground.  I'll be right back on the ground.  Yeah, it is.  It is useful.  Our hatred of the endead is how we first bonded, Torgoth, I recall fondly.  Something's got to keep the lights on.  I wait. Is Sean still Tom or?  Okay.  I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you.  nephew of Thraxus. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp.  more of the same. We spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I will be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  But what do you, both are as your, as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind.  Here, as close as one more.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, they're still putting ale in your mug.  And now you've officially started to play the game, man, this is what it's all about.  You  You  You  You  Probably a morning star. I think if I did a good job, it'd have like spikes on it.  I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded. But yeah.  It's a good palette or weapons.  I'm almost a smart guy once the war hammer.  Interesting.  You  You  Hey  You  You  You  You  This is my patron saint.  You  Fucking if you came out, bruh. I saw you post. He was like, they're sleeping together the cats and everything.  That's dope.  You blow up his spot.  He's back in the correct rhythm.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  I like will it save.  You  You  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like your torga.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Somebody does have to light the fire, Bubby, um, as do you know, and can you tell us anything  about this age of five?  I don't know that any of us are very well first and how.  And then what about the age of five, the one that we're taking?  Fantastic.  No further questions.  Thank you, Bubby.  I'm sorry.  Torgas, Torgas, a woman she doesn't understand for just fine.  But they do now, but they do now, but.  Torgas, you look beautiful getting a fucking divinity tanker, let's go.  Bye.  Torgas.  Torgas.  Can we approach the returning slot?  What gave it away?  It's good to meet you as well, Brain, or hopefully will not be the last time.  I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but.  In Helm's name, we must.  We have to go to the Sentinel shrine.  It has been extinguished.  I appreciate your faith that didn't.  The only thing keeping one foot in front of another, but.  We are here.  We have a new.  New man in our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see.  His full potential realized.  But I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there?  Do you have you are operating this thing?  Can you tell me the farthest you have gone?  We, I have never made a Sentinel shrine myself and I.  I know the journey will be long, but any any direction would be greatly appreciated.  So.  Very well.  Anybody else, would you mind if.  Any of our team has any other burning questions for you?  I don't know if that they do, but.  Well, brain or your your intel has been very valuable.  I hope to put it to good use.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Perhaps.  Perhaps the tinkerer will be of more use for age and knowledge.  I'm sorry.  Holy shit, he's right there.  So fuck, man.  Yes, yes, I, I, I'm sorry, master tinker.  A little bit preoccupied with that permission at hand.  That neither of us are two.  Not, not two thrilled.  So into the line, brother.  There's sending us to a Sentinel hill.  That will be our, as supposed to be archery.  What, what, what can you tell us about this.  Machine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very well.  Don't suppose you know which of.  Character sheets, that's.  Alright, well.  Does anybody.  Very well.  Thank you for your.  That yes, that will work.  Are either of you gentlemen good with your hands.  Bringo, you, are you, you said you're a pretty sharp mentally.  Yeah.  Well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And boat bar is strong.  So I'll let you do with that, what you will.  I'll let you do that.  I'll let you do that.  You would be a good fit for the mechanic.  I'd both.  Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You were asking about the weapon earlier.  If you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother.  You get the gun.  Smooth.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What is that, what is that, board bar?  Have you ever met a woman friend?  Dorgon does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her feminine  needs.  She's a very strong fighter, I promise.  Oh, my God.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  You  Well, do we think Ireland might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey?  And  And see if this is he can see us like right so if we if we approach ill yeah  I'll steer over to see  I  Do have very little shrine knowledge like most of the other dwarves I asked in that  God damn red iron box. So yes, let's let's see what Ireland has to say about the shrine  I  Mean so what is he these like up the tower is that?  We'll turn I'll get out. I'll try to be quick  I'll make my way towards the George Ireland  I'll  Turn lock marble jaw and  Porgobron and will bring those something or other old bar breathable this might  You might be the last dwarf to see us alive  Thanks  They do  Do you know anything?  So you know you know about the shrine then you know it's going out  You  Can you tell me what what would cause a shrine to extinguish?  Very well  Very well  I'll keep making my way up to you staircase  You  You  You  You  Not that I have not to mind I'll actually give us very little to go off of I was told it could have been bandits that took the crystal  You  Your secret safe of me, Ireland, but tell me what am I going to do with no warning stone and this is it I  Can't complete a mission with no tools  You  You  You  Have very much  Right in our ship I don't know where we would be without this stone so go with help  As you said, Ireland, it's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to to not regress at this point  Go without brother  Alright, we'll go back to live  Alright, you all are the may of saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer  There  Very well back on the back on the room  You  There we go  Yeah  You  It's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridiron, but yes, but it has been some time now to live  You  See  You  You  Yes, yes, we all love a good beer don't we  The  Good  All the  It is 1 o'clock somewhere, it's again plastered all over the wall.  There it is.  It's gone 4, 3, 2, 1, it's just crazy.  It's unfortunate, oh wait, shit, fuck, yeah, yeah, oh god, yeah, oh my god, oh my god  oh who is it who does I don't stop the tank, they're going to rob us, we need to get  to the shrine.  Boy, are you able to get a shot on whatever is approaching us?  Let's go, blow it shit, oh no!  So I got this thing is getting no traction.  Are you able to put water on it?  Okay, well all right, I don't bring a cart.  The mechanic spot.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  That's what you're supposed to be, Marga, oh my God.

Yeah, yeah, that would be, that would be my turn.  Let's do we think if we are able, I'm worried that will overheat.  I'm worried that will overheat.  There's an awful lot of them. If we could, I just, I, I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine.  I suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage.  We have enough range to, to take another shot.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I lost that fall of an assist.  I'm worried.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not I'm I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to see the stars. I'm not sure if I can get a question. I like will it say. Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torga. I'm still going to miss you. I'm curious if Bobby has any knowledge of that age of age. in five or where we're headed. Bobby, have you not heard when there's sending us? There's sending us to this Sentinel pride. It's sad to eat the dead, yes. Somebody does have to light the fire, Bubby. As do you know, can you tell us anything about this age in vibe? I don't know that any of us are very well first in. And then what about the HM5, the one that we're taking? Fantastic. No further questions. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's good to meet you as well, Brainer. Hopefully it will not be the last time. I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but... in Helm's name we must. We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine at his Benix English. I appreciate your faith that in the faith that I gained from Helm is the only thing keeping one foot in front of another. But we are here, new man and our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized. But I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there? Do you you are operating this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone? We, I have never made a descental shine myself and I know the journey will be long, but any direction would be greatly appreciated. Very well. Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if that they do, but. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that.

Perhaps the tinker will be of more use for age and knowledge, Boatbar. I'm sorry, master Tinkerware. So I did it into the line, brother. They're sending us to a sentinel hill. That will be our, as I suppose to be our cherries. What can you tell us about this machine? You Keep your feet on the ground. Very well. Don't suppose you know which of character sheets that's those Thank you very much. That yes, that will work. Are you either of you gentlemen good with your hands?

Suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage. We haven't arranged to take another shot. That's it. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie.

Yeah, I like the idea of like kind of like you're saying like figuring out how the Claire would play because like with Sherlock this is the first time or like trying to do like the no lying thing like sticking to a character like trade or flaw or something like that. I think it's a really interesting way to do it. I was well played though. Yeah, it's not a decorate the tank. It's fucking hilarious. Yeah. you I'm not sure if I can do that. yeah Follow yeah, yeah, it wasn't an excuse I Wait, this is at the Renfair What was this guy busking what do you mean a dollar you get anything for a dollar? I haven't seen I don't want to play anyway. Yeah, she's the mayor of fucking Renfair let's say. Yeah, like is it not like what are you falling on they don't is it anything inflated oh nah oh nah. I think like you see somebody throw a action you're like I can do that shit, but like there is a It's all religious Oh Jesus It's a D20 that was those heart is hard to see Yeah, I want to I want to go back to one person I do want to get a really like the idea of that Hold up I'm trying to blow you up give me a second. It's not working at all. Oh yeah, is it wood is it does it does it. I know. I'm dude, yeah, I'm a big also did I cut my video on accident?

We're gonna put you know every dude off So perhaps if we clear the additional weight off the tank quickly we can restart so I can we push that I want to push out and try to push this motherfucker off I guess. I for now yes You Eat them off bro You You You Make sense or I'm sitting So You You I Just I just saw it as soon as you said and I saw it I was imagining like a door with a latch, but I see no I know I get it's a fucking hole He's in a manhole.

Yeah, and if you're on the end of your on it should be on your attack. Hey You I'm gonna start jump next first out of there branching my slightly less impressive morning stuff because I didn't roll the side and the board. I'm gonna take a swing at the one that looks the the healthiest. That's going to be I have a plus hit but I didn't get any to plus damage. So Do Yes or my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yep. Yes sir. And Yeah, I'm also gonna put a device right on it. I almost did it. I almost did it. Fuck. Alright. Yep. It's gonna be like a radiant light that kind of like starts in his eyes and flows through a minute dust You You Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I'll see. Okay. Oh, Jesus. Can we get back in the fucking tank? you I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. I'm going to turn that blocker off. Sorry. I'll go down first and then if y'all know what to do with it. Okay, so yeah, so me and the mechanic. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. I can try to hit one of them, right? I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy.

I'm going to say if the road's quiet, can we pull over for like an hour and a half in the light? I think there's like one class or two. There's like, yeah. I don't know. Wait, no, I said clear. I have no idea. How it doesn't. Let's go, baby. Oh yeah, that's true. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. Peace. you you you I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tear and gas and zilgen. So, the question then that would tear and gas or zilgen be right? That's fair. I'm sorry. Not that I'm aware it was I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean, yeah, because yeah, you have to ask a very specific question because you can only give a response of like good batter not right like so I do. Yeah, I don't know. you I'm going to we're going to keep the course. I'm going to start the engine. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. you you you I'm last stop boys what do we think? with caution do we want to take the tank all the way to the tower if it seems quiet now? I'm going to you you you you I'm going to it's it's it's basically a stone tower obelisk right that that thing right there I'm I'm on a phone so I can't fucking see that grip. Well you I'm going to be able to do something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warding stone. Let's make our way in. it has been really hard trying to not I've been trying to keep that in mind when I addressed you well so the end last try in the warning stone was housed in the top so I think we should move. I can activate a tremorsense which is on any stone I can sense any movement or of any kind within 60 feet so essentially I want to see what's up there while we're making our way up like with my hand on the wall or something to I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door that is causing vibrations movement sound I will be aware of it. I think it's pretty strong but I that's yeah that's what it does. you you you you you you you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Oh shit. Wait what? you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. you you you you you Thanks so I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Alright, here's the previous warning stone is faded. I don't know if anybody can tell if there's foul play. I have not spent much time reading the good word of hell yet. There are lots of right-few young age of level three. So I don't know if anybody else might be more religiously inclined to handle the swap. I don't know if anybody wants to investigate this. I'm not good at that either. I'll hand over the stone. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you What the fuck was that? Fuck! No! Fuck! I'm scared! No, it was somebody do some... I'm scared! What did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Because he's about to lose a nephew. You need to explain yourself. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to roll initiative in one fucking second. You don't start talking. Unfortunately, both of our, I don't know which you did deserve this either. I'm rolling initiative. So, wow. 4. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm going to kill you and remove it from your body. All right. I'm going to kill you. Yeah, I used takeer to weapon to take it from a 5 to a 7. Yes, I do. I'm going to do. Yeah, we'll leave it at that for now. All right. Round three, baby. That's fucking good. So it's 44 damage. And is the cursor locked for the same turn? Yeah. What? No. No. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one.

I'm going to go to the next one. Dragon Balls now. you Okay. Okay. get to the attack. We just need to get in the vehicle. Let's go. No, yeah, no, no, no. Okay, we knew though there was like a sundering. We knew something happened, but we knew a little bit about like, but no, most of that fuck now. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in boot with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. So can I get a swing off one of them? Okay, but double that because it's radiant. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. And so that should create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn. This is what I think our goal is, or my goal is. Okay. I'm going to drive the thing, right? Well, I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. I'm going to throw out the target. I have to back it up. Is it a candle? The fucking double double was insane. It was the triple cross. Once. I told you I told you I could be getting it. I told you to be getting it. You still I'm just such a wonderful. I do like the main on the inside too. It's always a fun to do. Yeah. Is good. Is good. I dug it. But I do. I do. I do got to get ready for my fucking internship GGs.",
