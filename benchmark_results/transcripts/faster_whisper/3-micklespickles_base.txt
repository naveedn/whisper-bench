Yes, sir.  You  You  You  You  You  You  It is you  I enjoyed my  time out  Out of the city it's been enlightening but  It is good to see you familiar face, but it's hell out there  That's  It's ä¾†  go  But we just we've just escaped the escape of the lions and I do enjoy the work. Don't  get me wrong, but there must be some time for respite. How is this possible?  They said both are both are battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of  Thraxus.  Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but can you explain to me a little  bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang?  Let's start with the bad news.  Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to  complete this task. I'm back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again,  but can you tell me, why do we know why the shrine has gone out?  If that vandals come for these shrines like this before, I can't recall having been sent on  shrine duty in the past.  Very well sentinel shrine, the farthest shrine is going out and that will be accompanied by  Thrax's prodigy of an nephew, is that right?  And this HM, it's a piece of gear, does it?  Very well, we'll head there post-aiced.  Just like every other time they've sent me out, I'll keep coming back one way or another.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, it is.  It is useful.  Our hatred of the endead is how we first bonded, Torgoth, I recall fondly.  The endead is how we first bonded, Torgoth, I recall fondly.  Something has got to keep the lights on.  I wait. Is Sean still Tom or?  Of course.  Okay.  I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you.  nephew of Thraxus, I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp.  More of the same, we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  As your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I have only recently called wind.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, I still am putting ale in your mug.  And now you've officially started to play the game, man.  You  probably a morning star, I think if I did a good job, I'd have like spikes on it, I think if it didn't it would probably just be like studded, but yeah.  It's a good palette of weapons.  I want to miss a smart guy once the war hammer.  Hey.  Hey.  This is my patron saint.  You came out, bro, I saw you post he was like they're sleeping together the cats and everything.  You blow up his spot.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame, that's why I like your torga.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Before we shove off, I'm curious if Bobby has any knowledge of that HM five or where we're headed.  Bobby, have you not heard when they're sending us?  They're sending us to send to this Sentinel pride.  It's sad to be dead, yes.  Somebody does have to light the fire, Bobby.  As do you know, can you tell us anything about this HM five?  I don't know that any of us are very well first in.  And then what about the HM five, the one that we're taking?  Fantastic, no further questions, thank you, Bobby.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  It's a woman she doesn't understand for just fine.  But they do now, but they do now.  You look beautiful getting a fucking divinity tanker, let's go.  Okay.  Bye.  I can we approach the returning slot?  I can we approach the returning slot?  What gave it away?  It's good to meet you as well, Brainer.  Hopefully it will not be the last time.  I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but...  It's been Helm's name we must.  We have to go to the Sentinel shrine.  It has been extinguished.  I appreciate your faith that in the faith that I gained from Helm is the only thing  that's keeping one foot in front of another.  But we are here, we have a new man in our red and new young prodigy  which we will hopefully see his full potential realized.  But I need you to let me know, what are we getting into out there?  You are operating this thing?  Can you tell me the farthest you have gone?  I have never made a Sentinel shrine myself and I...  I know the journey will be long but any direction would be greatly appreciated.  Very well.  Anybody else would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you?  I don't know what they do, but...  I don't know what they do.  I don't know what they do.  I don't know what they do.  A little brain or your intel has been very valuable.  I hope to put it to good use.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Perhaps the tinkerer will be of more use for age and knowledge.  He's right there.  Yes, yes.  I'm sorry, master tinkerer.  A little bit preoccupied with the mission at hand.  So, to the end of the line, we're there sending us to a Sentinel Hill.  That will be our...  It's supposed to be our cherries.  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  What can you tell us about this machine?  Very well.  Don't suppose you know which character sheet stands.  Thank you very much.  Very well.  Thank you for your...  That yes.  That will work.  Are you either of you gentlemen good with your hands?  Bringo, you said you're pretty sharp mentally.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And boat bar is strong.  So, I'll let you do with that what you will.  Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic?  I'd boat bar.  Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You are asking about the weapon earlier.  If you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother.  You get the gun.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Good.  Good.  All of them.  All of them.  Yeah.  All of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both of our have to have protection of me being able to.  So as far as defensive spells, you know, that should be.  Oh,  We burn a rubber, baby.  I want to look for spray paint.
