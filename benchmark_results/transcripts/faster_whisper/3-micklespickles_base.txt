Yes, sir.  You  You  You  You  display  Storm Guerin is good to see you brother, I have enjoyed my putting out of out of the city it has been enlightening  But a if it is good to see a familiar face but it's hell out there  We just escaped the landscape of the lands and I do enjoy the work don't get me wrong  but there must be some time for respite how is this possible  it is a new name to me tell me about this nephew of the  well then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang?  So start with the bad news  So  Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to  complete this task. I've come back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again.  But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out?  And that vandals come for these shrines like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past.  Very well, sentinel shrine, the farthest shrine is going out. And that will be accompanied by Thrax's  strategy of an nephew. Was that right?  And this hm will it's a it's a piece of gear.  Does it go on?  Very well. We'll head there post-taste.  Just like every other time they've sent me out I'll keep coming back one way or another.  Keep your feet on the ground.  I'll be right back on the ground.  Yeah, it is.  It is useful.  Our hatred of the endead is how we first bonded, Torgoth, I recall fondly.  Something's got to keep the lights on.  I wait. Is Sean still Tom or?  Okay.  I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you.  nephew of Thraxus. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp.  more of the same. We spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I will be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  But what do you, both are as your, as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind.  Here, as close as one more.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, they're still putting ale in your mug.  And now you've officially started to play the game, man, this is what it's all about.  You  You  You  You  Probably a morning star. I think if I did a good job, it'd have like spikes on it.  I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded. But yeah.  It's a good palette or weapons.  I'm almost a smart guy once the war hammer.  Interesting.  You  You  Hey  You  You  You  You  This is my patron saint.  You  Fucking if you came out, bruh. I saw you post. He was like, they're sleeping together the cats and everything.  That's dope.  You blow up his spot.  He's back in the correct rhythm.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  I like will it save.  You  You  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like your torga.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Somebody does have to light the fire, Bubby, um, as do you know, and can you tell us anything  about this age of five?  I don't know that any of us are very well first and how.  And then what about the age of five, the one that we're taking?  Fantastic.  No further questions.  Thank you, Bubby.  I'm sorry.  Torgas, Torgas, a woman she doesn't understand for just fine.  But they do now, but they do now, but.  Torgas, you look beautiful getting a fucking divinity tanker, let's go.  Bye.  Torgas.  Torgas.  Can we approach the returning slot?  What gave it away?  It's good to meet you as well, Brain, or hopefully will not be the last time.  I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but.  In Helm's name, we must.  We have to go to the Sentinel shrine.  It has been extinguished.  I appreciate your faith that didn't.  The only thing keeping one foot in front of another, but.  We are here.  We have a new.  New man in our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see.  His full potential realized.  But I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there?  Do you have you are operating this thing?  Can you tell me the farthest you have gone?  We, I have never made a Sentinel shrine myself and I.  I know the journey will be long, but any any direction would be greatly appreciated.  So.  Very well.  Anybody else, would you mind if.  Any of our team has any other burning questions for you?  I don't know if that they do, but.  Well, brain or your your intel has been very valuable.  I hope to put it to good use.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Perhaps.  Perhaps the tinkerer will be of more use for age and knowledge.  I'm sorry.  Holy shit, he's right there.  So fuck, man.  Yes, yes, I, I, I'm sorry, master tinker.  A little bit preoccupied with that permission at hand.  That neither of us are two.  Not, not two thrilled.  So into the line, brother.  There's sending us to a Sentinel hill.  That will be our, as supposed to be archery.  What, what, what can you tell us about this.  Machine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very well.  Don't suppose you know which of.  Character sheets, that's.  Alright, well.  Does anybody.  Very well.  Thank you for your.  That yes, that will work.  Are either of you gentlemen good with your hands.  Bringo, you, are you, you said you're a pretty sharp mentally.  Yeah.  Well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And boat bar is strong.  So I'll let you do with that, what you will.  I'll let you do that.  I'll let you do that.  You would be a good fit for the mechanic.  I'd both.  Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You were asking about the weapon earlier.  If you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother.  You get the gun.  Smooth.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good.  Thank you.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  We burn a rubber baby.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What is that, what is that, board bar?  Have you ever met a woman friend?  Dorgon does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her feminine  needs.  She's a very strong fighter, I promise.  Oh, my God.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  You  Well, do we think Ireland might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey?  And  And see if this is he can see us like right so if we if we approach ill yeah  I'll steer over to see  I  Do have very little shrine knowledge like most of the other dwarves I asked in that  God damn red iron box. So yes, let's let's see what Ireland has to say about the shrine  I  Mean so what is he these like up the tower is that?  We'll turn I'll get out. I'll try to be quick  I'll make my way towards the George Ireland  I'll  Turn lock marble jaw and  Porgobron and will bring those something or other old bar breathable this might  You might be the last dwarf to see us alive  Thanks  They do  Do you know anything?  So you know you know about the shrine then you know it's going out  You  Can you tell me what what would cause a shrine to extinguish?  Very well  Very well  I'll keep making my way up to you staircase  You  You  You  You  Not that I have not to mind I'll actually give us very little to go off of I was told it could have been bandits that took the crystal  You  Your secret safe of me, Ireland, but tell me what am I going to do with no warning stone and this is it I  Can't complete a mission with no tools  You  You  You  Have very much  Right in our ship I don't know where we would be without this stone so go with help  As you said, Ireland, it's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to to not regress at this point  Go without brother  Alright, we'll go back to live  Alright, you all are the may of saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer  There  Very well back on the back on the room  You  There we go  Yeah  You  It's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridiron, but yes, but it has been some time now to live  You  See  You  You  Yes, yes, we all love a good beer don't we  The  Good  All the  It is 1 o'clock somewhere, it's again plastered all over the wall.  There it is.  It's gone 4, 3, 2, 1, it's just crazy.  It's unfortunate, oh wait, shit, fuck, yeah, yeah, oh god, yeah, oh my god, oh my god  oh who is it who does I don't stop the tank, they're going to rob us, we need to get  to the shrine.  Boy, are you able to get a shot on whatever is approaching us?  Let's go, blow it shit, oh no!  So I got this thing is getting no traction.  Are you able to put water on it?  Okay, well all right, I don't bring a cart.  The mechanic spot.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  That's what you're supposed to be, Marga, oh my God.

Yeah, yeah, that would be, that would be my turn.  Let's do we think if we are able, I'm worried that will overheat.  I'm worried that will overheat.  There's an awful lot of them. If we could, I just, I, I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine.  I suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage.  We have enough range to, to take another shot.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I lost that fall of an assist.  I'm worried.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
