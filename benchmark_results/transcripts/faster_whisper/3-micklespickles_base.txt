Yes, sir.  You  You  You  You  You  You  Oh  Stolen Grim and it's good to see you, brother. I've enjoyed my time out of out of the city. It has been enlightening, but it is good to see a familiar face, but his hell out there.  It's  But we just we've just escaped the escape of the lions and I I do enjoy the work. Don't get me wrong, but there must be some time for respect. How is this possible?  You said both are both are battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the access.  Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but.  Can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang?  Start with the bad news.  Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to complete this task.  I'm back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again, but can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out?  And that vandals come for the shrine like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past.  Very well sentinel shrine before the shrine is going out and I will be accompanied by Thrax's strategy of an nephew.  Is that right?  And this HM, it's a piece of gear. Does it go on?  Very well, we'll head there post-aiced.  Just like every other time they've sent me out, I'll keep coming back one way or another.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right, true to the end of this is how we first bond in Torgoth.  I recall finally.  Thank you.  So something's got something to keep the lights on.  Wait, is the shrine still tomorrows?  No, no, no.  I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you nephew of Thrax's I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp.  More of the same, we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  Over as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, I still putting ale in your mug.  And now you're not even officially started to play the game, man.  You  You  You  You  Probably a morning star.  I think if I did a good job and have like spikes on it, I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded but yeah.  It's a good palette of weapons.  I'm going to miss a smart guy once the war hammer.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  This is my patron saint.  Fucking if he came out, bro, I saw he posted he was like, they're sleeping together, they're cats and everything.  That's  No  You  You  You  You  You  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Interarah, you've been able to set up the  application right?  Press P to your table. What's the important need to do with all of the  things I'm trying to do?  Dan best wants to try out.  Okay.  And, okay.  We'll do this.  I'll give you a little quick.  Can we do that first?  Okay.  I'm gonna stop playing.  Good.  It's the same.  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torega.  That's what you want.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Before we shove off, I'm curious if Bubby has any knowledge of the HM5 or where we're heading.  Bubby, have you not heard when there's sending us?  Can you tell us anything about this HM5?  What about the HM5?  Fantastic.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you, Bubby.

Bringo, you said you're pretty sharp mentally.  OK, well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And both of our is strong.  So I'll let you do with that, what you will.  Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic.  I'd both of ours.  Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You were asking about the weapon earlier.  If you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother, you get the gun.  It's over.  OK.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Oh, sorry.  Good.  Yeah.  I was going to say, I know, I know at least myself and both of our have to have protection.  So I'm going to be able to.  So like as far as defensive spells go like that should be.  We burn a rubber baby.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  I wanna look for spray paint.  As long as the shrine is out the worst get dead we'll get.  Go ahead, Brian.  You  You  Let's say what's what is that bow bar have you ever met a woman friend  Dorgon does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her feminine needs. She's a very strong fighter. I promise  you  You  Oh my god  You  You  Well, do we think our land might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey  And he have this he's you can see us like right so if we if we approach it. Yeah  I'll steer over to see  I do have very little shrine knowledge like most of the other dwarves I asked and that got in red iron box. So yes, let's let's see what Arland has to say about the shrine  You  I mean, so what is he these like up the tower is that  It's all right. We'll turn I'll get out. I'll try to be quick  And I'll make my way towards the George Arland  You  Sherlock marble jaw and  Porgobron and will bring those something or other old bar breathable this might  You might be the last dwarf to see us alive  They do  Do you know anything  So you know you know about the shrine then you know it's going out  When can you tell me what what would cause a shrine to extinguish  As  Very well  I'll keep making my way up to use their case  You  You  You  You  Not that I have not to mind. I'll actually given us very little to go off of I was told it could have been bandits that took the crystal  You  Your secret safe of me Arland but tell me what am I going to do with no warning stone and this is it  I can't complete a mission with no tools  You  You  Thank you Arland you  To have very much  Write in our ship. I don't know where we would be without this stone. So go with help  As you said Arland. It's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to to not regress at this point  Go without brother  All right, we'll go back to live  You  All right y'all  Arland may have saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer  You  Very well back on the back on the room  There we go  You have it  You  It's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridter and but  Yes, but it has been some time now to live  See  You  You  Yes, we all love a good beard  And  This is all the game  It's  It is one o'clock somewhere  And flashed it all over the walls  There it is  You  Unfortunately, oh wait, oh shit fuck  Yeah  Oh god, yeah  Oh my god  You  You  You  Oh, who is it  I don't stop the tank  You  They're going to rob us. We need to get to the shrine  You  Ah  You  You  But are you able to get a shot on whatever is approaching us?  All right  You  You  You  You  You  Let's go  Oh, no  You  You  You  So I got this thing is getting no traction. Are you able to put water on it?  You  Very well, all right or I don't bring a cart  The mechanic spot  You  You  I thought he was supposed to be Marga. Oh my god  Oh  Oh  Thank you very much.  You  You  Okay, can you can you can you kind of water those there?  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  So  Can  I got it  Yeah, yeah, that would be it, that would be mine, then.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's do we think if we are able, I'm worried that we'll overheat.  There is an awful lot of them and if we could, I just, I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine.  We'll think of face to front and bring it in.  Suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage.  We haven't arranged to take another shot.  Thanks for watching.  Thank you.  Thanks.  I like not falling for that.  I'm impressed with your voice and I care.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can you hear me?  No, I trust you.
