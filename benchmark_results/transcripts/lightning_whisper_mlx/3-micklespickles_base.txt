I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. out there. We just, we just escaped the else's escape of the lands and I do enjoy the work. There must be some time for respect. How is this possible? It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the access. Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang? So, start with the bad news. Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence and us to complete this task. I've come back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again. But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out? And that vandals come for these shrines like this before I can't recall having been sent on Shrine Beauty in the past. Very well, Sentinel Shrine, the Farthest Shrine is going out. And that will be accompanied by Thrax's strategy of an FU. Was that right? And this HM, it's a piece of gear. Does it go on? Very well. We'll head there post-aiced. one way or another. Keep your feet on the ground. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. Yeah, that's... Excuse me. All right, Trudeau of the NDEAD is how we first bonded, Torgoth. I recall fondly. So something's got to keep the lights on. Wait, is Sean still Tom? Okay. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you. nephew of Thraxus. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. More of the same. We spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey. I'm going to have to go to the next one. Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. And now you've officially started to play the game, man. You I'm going to go to the next one. Probably a morning star. I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded. But yeah. It's a good palette or weapons. Interesting. I'm going to be a little bit more. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to see the stars. I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not I'm I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to see the stars. I'm not sure if I can get a question. I like will it say. Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torga. I'm still going to miss you. I'm curious if Bobby has any knowledge of that age of age. in five or where we're headed. Bobby, have you not heard when there's sending us? There's sending us to this Sentinel pride. It's sad to eat the dead, yes. Somebody does have to light the fire, Bubby. As do you know, can you tell us anything about this age in vibe? I don't know that any of us are very well first in. And then what about the HM5, the one that we're taking? Fantastic. No further questions. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You look beautiful getting a fucking divinity tanker. Let's go. I can we approach the returning slot. What gave it away? It's good to meet you as well, Brainer. Hopefully it will not be the last time. I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but... in Helm's name we must. We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine at his Benix English. I appreciate your faith that in the faith that I gained from Helm is the only thing keeping one foot in front of another. But we are here, new man and our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized. But I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there? Do you you are operating this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone? We, I have never made a descental shine myself and I know the journey will be long, but any direction would be greatly appreciated. Very well. Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if that they do, but. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Keep your feet on the ground. Keep your feet on the ground. Perhaps the tinker will be of more use for age and knowledge, Boatbar. I'm sorry, master Tinkerware. So I did it into the line, brother. They're sending us to a sentinel hill. That will be our, as I suppose to be our cherries. What can you tell us about this machine? You Keep your feet on the ground. Very well. Don't suppose you know which of character sheets that's those Thank you very much. That yes, that will work. Are you either of you gentlemen good with your hands? Okay, well, I'm thinking, Ringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. And both of our is wrong. So I'll let you do with that, what you will. I'd both of us. Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot? You were asking about the Well said brother. You get the gun. Okay. Oh, sorry. I know I know at least myself in both of our have to have protection from We burn a rubber baby. I want to look for spray paint. Go ahead, Bringo. I'm not going to be a good guy. You're not going to be a good guy. You're not going to be a good guy. The organ does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Well, do we think Ireland might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey? I mean, so what is he like up the tower? I'll get out. I'll try to be quick. I'll make my way towards the George Ireland. They do. Do you know anything? Can you tell me what would cause a shrine to extinguish? I'll keep making my way up to you staircase. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not that I have not to mind. I'm not going to be a good guy. You're secret safe with me, Ireland. Thank you, Ireland. You have very much right in our ship. I don't know where we would be without this stone. I'm not going to be a good guy. As you said, Ireland, it's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to to not regress at this point. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm going to go. I'm sorry.

There is an awful lot of them and if we could, I just, I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine. brigands. Suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage. We haven't arranged to take another shot. That's it. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie.

Yeah, I like the idea of like kind of like you're saying like figuring out how the Claire would play because like with Sherlock this is the first time or like trying to do like the no lying thing like sticking to a character like trade or flaw or something like that. I think it's a really interesting way to do it. I was well played though. Yeah, it's not a decorate the tank. It's fucking hilarious. Yeah. you I'm not sure if I can do that. yeah Follow yeah, yeah, it wasn't an excuse I Wait, this is at the Renfair What was this guy busking what do you mean a dollar you get anything for a dollar? I haven't seen I don't want to play anyway. Yeah, she's the mayor of fucking Renfair let's say. Yeah, like is it not like what are you falling on they don't is it anything inflated oh nah oh nah. I think like you see somebody throw a action you're like I can do that shit, but like there is a It's all religious Oh Jesus It's a D20 that was those heart is hard to see Yeah, I want to I want to go back to one person I do want to get a really like the idea of that Hold up I'm trying to blow you up give me a second. It's not working at all. Oh yeah, is it wood is it does it does it. I know. I'm dude, yeah, I'm a big also did I cut my video on accident?

Oh For 44 plus four side is so good though You You So I grabbed a bike baby Turn that motherfucker to the left to keep going I do Okay, that's good though Which is bad right yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You You I So I'm just like is that like metagame is that does that make sense? We're gonna put you know every dude off So perhaps if we clear the additional weight off the tank quickly we can restart so I can we push that I want to push out and try to push this motherfucker off I guess. I for now yes You Eat them off bro You You You Make sense or I'm sitting So You You I Just I just saw it as soon as you said and I saw it I was imagining like a door with a latch, but I see no I know I get it's a fucking hole He's in a manhole.

Yeah, and if you're on the end of your on it should be on your attack. Hey You I'm gonna start jump next first out of there branching my slightly less impressive morning stuff because I didn't roll the side and the board. I'm gonna take a swing at the one that looks the the healthiest. That's going to be I have a plus hit but I didn't get any to plus damage. So Do Yes or my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yep. Yes sir. And Yeah, I'm also gonna put a device right on it. I almost did it. I almost did it. Fuck. Alright. Yep. It's gonna be like a radiant light that kind of like starts in his eyes and flows through a minute dust You You Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I'll see. Okay. Oh, Jesus. Can we get back in the fucking tank? you I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. I'm going to turn that blocker off. Sorry. I'll go down first and then if y'all know what to do with it. Okay, so yeah, so me and the mechanic. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. I can try to hit one of them, right? I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy. Oh, three. I'm going to say if the road's quiet, can we pull over for like an hour and a half in the light? I think there's like one class or two. There's like, yeah. I don't know. Wait, no, I said clear. I have no idea. How it doesn't. Let's go, baby. Oh yeah, that's true. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. Peace. you you you I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tear and gas and zilgen. So, the question then that would tear and gas or zilgen be right? That's fair. I'm sorry. Not that I'm aware it was I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean, yeah, because yeah, you have to ask a very specific question because you can only give a response of like good batter not right like so I do. Yeah, I don't know. you I'm going to we're going to keep the course. I'm going to start the engine. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. you you you I'm last stop boys what do we think? with caution do we want to take the tank all the way to the tower if it seems quiet now? I'm going to you you you you I'm going to it's it's it's basically a stone tower obelisk right that that thing right there I'm I'm on a phone so I can't fucking see that grip. Well you I'm going to be able to do something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warding stone. Let's make our way in. it has been really hard trying to not I've been trying to keep that in mind when I addressed you well so the end last try in the warning stone was housed in the top so I think we should move. I can activate a tremorsense which is on any stone I can sense any movement or of any kind within 60 feet so essentially I want to see what's up there while we're making our way up like with my hand on the wall or something to I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door that is causing vibrations movement sound I will be aware of it. I think it's pretty strong but I that's yeah that's what it does. you you you you you you you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Oh shit. Wait what? you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. you you you you you Thanks so I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Alright, here's the previous warning stone is faded. I don't know if anybody can tell if there's foul play. I have not spent much time reading the good word of hell yet. There are lots of right-few young age of level three. So I don't know if anybody else might be more religiously inclined to handle the swap. I don't know if anybody wants to investigate this. I'm not good at that either. I'll hand over the stone. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you What the fuck was that? Fuck! No! Fuck! I'm scared! No, it was somebody do some... I'm scared! What did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Because he's about to lose a nephew. You need to explain yourself. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to roll initiative in one fucking second. You don't start talking. Unfortunately, both of our, I don't know which you did deserve this either. I'm rolling initiative. So, wow. 4. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm going to kill you and remove it from your body. All right. I'm going to kill you. Yeah, I used takeer to weapon to take it from a 5 to a 7. Yes, I do. I'm going to do. Yeah, we'll leave it at that for now. All right. Round three, baby. That's fucking good. So it's 44 damage. And is the cursor locked for the same turn? Yeah. What? No. No. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one.

I'm going to go to the next one. Dragon Balls now. you Okay. Okay. get to the attack. We just need to get in the vehicle. Let's go. No, yeah, no, no, no. Okay, we knew though there was like a sundering. We knew something happened, but we knew a little bit about like, but no, most of that fuck now. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in boot with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. So can I get a swing off one of them? Okay, but double that because it's radiant. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. And so that should create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn. This is what I think our goal is, or my goal is. Okay. I'm going to drive the thing, right? Well, I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. I'm going to throw out the target. I have to back it up. Is it a candle? The fucking double double was insane. It was the triple cross. Once. I told you I told you I could be getting it. I told you to be getting it. You still I'm just such a wonderful. I do like the main on the inside too. It's always a fun to do. Yeah. Is good. Is good. I dug it. But I do. I do. I do got to get ready for my fucking internship GGs.
