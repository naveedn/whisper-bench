Yeah Both are battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the Thraxus. Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang? I'm sorry. Start with the bad news. You Well, I have to imagine you he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to complete this task. I've got back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again. But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out? And that bandals come for the shrines like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past. I'm sorry. Very well. Sentinel shrine before the shrine is going out and that will be accompanied by Thraxus. It's part of J of an nephew. Is that right? And this hm will it's a it's a piece of gear does it go on? Very well. We'll head there post-aiced. Just like every other time they've sent me out I'll keep coming back one way or another. Keep your feet on the ground. yeah Yes All right, true to the end of this is how we first bonded. Yeah, So something's got something to keep the lights on. I wait. Is it sure the shot still Tom or. And. I don't know. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you. I guess the net view of Theraxis. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. More of the same, we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey. Bob, are you, Bob, are you, as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission that you're going to be doing? Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. Bobby, are you still putting ale in your mug? And now you've officially started a play of the game, man. This is what it's all about. Probably a morning star. I think if I did a good job, it would probably just be like studded. But yeah. It's a good paladir weapons. Oh, Mr. Smart Guy wants the war hammer. Interesting. Think of an хоть problems.

I can we approach the returning slot? What gave it away? It's good to me to choose well, Brain, or hopefully it will not be the last time. I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but. In hell, the name we must. We have to go to the Sentinel's throin. It has been extinguished. I appreciate your faith that in the faith that I gained from hell is the only thing keeping one foot in front of another. But we are here. We have a new. New man in our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized, but I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there? Do you have you are operating this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone we I have never made a sentinel shine myself and I. I know the journey will be long, but any any direction would be greatly appreciated. Very well. Anybody else. Would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if that they do, but. You are very valuable. I hope to put it to good use. Keep your feet on the ground. Perhaps the tinker will be of more use for age and knowledge, both are. Yes, yes, I'm sorry, master tinker. A little bit preoccupied. I'm not too thrilled about that. So did it into the line brother. There's sending us to a sentinel hill.

Not nearly as compact though. I got broke treat. Treat treat yourself. And plus you returned all that. Occupy bullshit right. So yeah, you're five. Yeah. I can't. I felt like I was watching like a Christmas movie. We tried, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Rodrigo wasn't to it. Rodrigo wasn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You sound good now. Yeah. 44 plus four. So good though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So perhaps if we clear the additional weight off the tank, quickly we can restart. So I can we push out and try to push this motherfucker off, I guess. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense, Ramson. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just I just saw it as soon as you said it I saw it. I was imagining like a door with a latch, but I see no, I know I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to start jump next. First out of there. Yeah. I have a plus hit, but I didn't get any of plus damage. So do. Yes, so my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yes, sir. That's damage. Yeah. I'm also going to put a device right on it. I almost did it. Fuck. Yep. It's going to be like a radiant light that kind of like starts in his eyes, and it's going to be like dust. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. Yeah. I'm going to turn that. I'm going to turn that. Sorry. I'm going to turn that. Oh. Bring. Bring. Bring. Bring. I can try to hit one of them. I can try to hit one of them right. I can try to hit one of them right. I can try to hit one of them right.

The path is to avoid taran gas and zilgen. build to find safe passage through terrain gas floors. I don't know. Because right now, this is where our trajectory is around it, right? Okay. Not that I'm aware it was going to be. something somebody said that out there embora site. Yeah, because yeah, you have to ask a very specific question because you can only give a response of like good, bad or not, right? So like, yeah, I don't know. Th 5 no No We're going to keep the course. Bring dollars this smart one. We got a little bit of a day. Well, now we know. I guess I'm going to start the engines. I'm going to start the engine. Alright, alright. I'm going to start the engine. He's a girl. That works. They're both good. I'm going to start the engine. I'm going to start the engine. I'm going to start the engine.
