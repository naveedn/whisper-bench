Sorry you you you You Stone Grim and it's good to see you, brother. I've enjoyed my time out of out of the city. It has been enlightening, but It is good to see a familiar face, but it's hell out there. We just We just we've just escaped the else's escape of the lands and I I do enjoy the work don't get me wrong but it must be some time for respect. How is this possible? I said, bowed bar. Bowed bar battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the Thraxus. Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Start with the bad news. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to complete this task. I've come back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again. But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out? I'm sorry. And that bandals come for the shrine like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past. Very well. Sentinel shrine before the shrine is going out and that will be accompanied by Thraxus. And this HM will it's a it's a piece of gear. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Very well. We'll head there post-aiced. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just like every other time they've sent me out. I'll keep coming back one way or another. Keep your feet on the ground. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. All right, true to the end of this is how we first bonded, I have a call finally. So something's got something to keep the lights on. I wait is it sure it's still Tom or. Okay. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but it is good to meet you. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. More of the same we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey. But what do you. But as your father as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind. Here. Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. I'll be. I still putting a little more. I'm. I'm. I'm. And now you're not even officially started to play the game man this. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Probably a morning star I think if I did a good job it have like spikes on it I think if it didn't probably just be like studded. But yeah. It's a good palette or weapons. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. This is my patron saint. Fucking. If he came out, bro, I saw he was like they're sleeping together the cats and everything. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I like. I like. We'll save. We'll save. We'll save. We'll save. Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torgah. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Before we shove off, I'm curious if Bubby has any knowledge of. I'm. Bubby, have you not heard when there's sending us? There's sending us to send to this Sentinel. I'm. I'm. I'm. Somebody does have to like the fire, Bubby. As. Do you know, can you tell us anything about this agent vibe? I don't know that any of us are very well first in. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And then. I don't know. Fantastic. No further questions. You You. You. You. You. You. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. You look beautiful. Get in the fucking divinity tanker. Let's go. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I can we approach the returning slot. What gave it away? It's good to meet you as well, Brain, or hopefully it will not be the last time. I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but... In Helm's name we must... We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine, it has been extinguished. I appreciate your faith. The only thing keeping one foot in front of another. We are here, we have a new man in our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized. But I need you to let me know. What are we getting into out there? Do you operate this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone? I have never made a Sentinel shine myself, and I know the journey will be long, but any direction would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure you've heard about it. I'm sure you've heard about it. Very well. Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if they do, but... Well, Brain or your intel has been very valuable. I hope to put it to good use. Keep your feet on the ground. I hope you've enjoyed this video. And if you did, please subscribe to my channel.

Perhaps the Tinkerbell will be of more use for age and knowledge, both of our. Holy shit, he's right there. Don't fuck me. Yes, yes, I'm sorry, Master Tinkerbell. I'm a little bit preoccupied with that mission at hand. I need a Master 2. No, I'm too thrilled about it. I'll get it into the line. That will be our, as opposed to be our cherries. What can you tell us about this machine? I'm sorry. Very well. Don't suppose you know which of character sheets that's not correct. All right, well, does anybody. Very well. Thank you for your. That yes, that will work. Thank you. Are either of you gentlemen good with your hands. Okay, well, I'm thinking. I'm thinking about the first one. And Boatbar is wrong. So I'll let you do it that what you will. Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic. I'm going to be a good guy. Well said, brother, you get the gun. Smooth. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know, I know at least myself and Boatbar have to have protection. I don't know if I like that should be. Thank you. We burn a rubber baby. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're using me in a fucking tank. What is that, Boatbar? Have you ever met a woman friend? She's a very strong fighter. Oh my God. Oh, my God. Oh my gosh. Well, do we think Ireland might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey? I do have very little shrine knowledge, like most of the other dwarves I asked in that garden, red iron box. So yes, let's see what Ireland has to say about the shrine. I mean, so what is he, he's like up the tower is that I'll get out, I'll try to be quick. I'll make my way towards Ireland. So I'll talk to Marblejaw and Paul, Brian and Bill, bring something or other boat varbrestle. This might, you might be the last dwarf to see us alive. They do. Do you know anything? So you know about the shrine then you know it's going out. Can you tell me what would cause a shrine to extinguish? Very well. I'll keep making my way up to you staircase. You know that I'm not that I have not to mind, I'll give it us very little to go off of. So there could have been bandits that took the crystal. I don't know where we would be without this stone. So go with help. So you said Ireland it's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to not regress at this point. Go with Elbrotha. Alright, we'll go back to them. And you all are the may of saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer. Very well back on the back on the room. I will go. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridiron, but yeah, but it has been some time now to live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who is it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we think if we are able to. Yeah. There is an awful lot of them. If we could. I just I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine. Yeah. I'm not going to waste too much time getting to the shrine. Yeah. We have enough range to take another shot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're in the beginning. Okay. Yeah. No, no, that was because I went into my garage to smoke and that's like the fucking. It's that in between area where my phone can't decide to do Wi-Fi or service. So that was. No, I trust me. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be a blood bath. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was well played though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was he like in character? The guy that was playing was he like a. Follow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to play anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it not like what are you falling on? They don't. Is it anything inflated? Oh, nah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's all relatively. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That. Okay. Now I can see it on that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to start jump next. First out of there. Yeah. I have a plus hit, but I didn't get any of the plus damage. So do. Yes, my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yep. Yeah. That's that damage. Yeah. Yeah. Almost did it. Fuck. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. Yeah. I'm sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can try to hit one of them right. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are we going to say if the road's quiet, can we pull over for like hour and a half of the like. Yeah. I think there's like one class or two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tearing gas and zilgen. Right. That's fair. Yeah. Like, will. Yeah. Because right now, assuming our trajectory is around it, right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's your guys. Yeah. So we're going to keep we're going to keep the course. Bring dollars this smart one. Yeah. Well, now we know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's a girl. That works. They're both good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's basically a stone tower obelisk right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I was no great catastrophes, certainly something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warding stone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It has been really hard trying to not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so the end last shrine, the warning stone was housed in the top. So I think we should move. Of the stairs here and see what's become of the previous warning stone. So I think we should move. So I think we should move. Yeah. So trimmer sense is on any solid like stone or like material like stone, but yeah, you can I can sense vibrations. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. Wait, what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Because he's about to lose a nephew. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, both of our I don't know which you did deserve this either. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to kill you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's quad there. Yeah. So at 44. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And is the crystal actor for the same term if it's in turn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I will get get back in the tank and get the fuck out of here. We'll just use turn on dead to drive through the whole world. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in food with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. Yeah. Okay, but double that because it's radiant. Yeah. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. Yeah. I think that's what I think our goal is to create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn is what I think our goal is or my goal is. Yeah. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. So now we just got to drive the drive the thing right. I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
