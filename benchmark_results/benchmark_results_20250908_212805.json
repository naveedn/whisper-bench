    "transcript": "Sorry you you you You Stone Grim and it's good to see you, brother. I've enjoyed my time out of out of the city. It has been enlightening, but It is good to see a familiar face, but it's hell out there. We just We just we've just escaped the else's escape of the lands and I I do enjoy the work don't get me wrong but it must be some time for respect. How is this possible? I said, bowed bar. Bowed bar battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the Thraxus. Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Start with the bad news. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence in us to complete this task. I've come back from every other trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again. But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out? I'm sorry. And that bandals come for the shrine like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past. Very well. Sentinel shrine before the shrine is going out and that will be accompanied by Thraxus. And this HM will it's a it's a piece of gear. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Very well. We'll head there post-aiced. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just like every other time they've sent me out. I'll keep coming back one way or another. Keep your feet on the ground. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. All right, true to the end of this is how we first bonded, I have a call finally. So something's got something to keep the lights on. I wait is it sure it's still Tom or. Okay. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but it is good to meet you. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. More of the same we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey. But what do you. But as your father as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind. Here. Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. I'll be. I still putting a little more. I'm. I'm. I'm. And now you're not even officially started to play the game man this. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Probably a morning star I think if I did a good job it have like spikes on it I think if it didn't probably just be like studded. But yeah. It's a good palette or weapons. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. This is my patron saint. Fucking. If he came out, bro, I saw he was like they're sleeping together the cats and everything. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I like. I like. We'll save. We'll save. We'll save. We'll save. Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torgah. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. Before we shove off, I'm curious if Bubby has any knowledge of. I'm. Bubby, have you not heard when there's sending us? There's sending us to send to this Sentinel. I'm. I'm. I'm. Somebody does have to like the fire, Bubby. As. Do you know, can you tell us anything about this agent vibe? I don't know that any of us are very well first in. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And then. I don't know. Fantastic. No further questions. You You. You. You. You. You. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. Target. You look beautiful. Get in the fucking divinity tanker. Let's go. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I can we approach the returning slot. What gave it away? It's good to meet you as well, Brain, or hopefully it will not be the last time. I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but... In Helm's name we must... We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine, it has been extinguished. I appreciate your faith. The only thing keeping one foot in front of another. We are here, we have a new man in our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized. But I need you to let me know. What are we getting into out there? Do you operate this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone? I have never made a Sentinel shine myself, and I know the journey will be long, but any direction would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure you've heard about it. I'm sure you've heard about it. Very well. Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if they do, but... Well, Brain or your intel has been very valuable. I hope to put it to good use. Keep your feet on the ground. I hope you've enjoyed this video. And if you did, please subscribe to my channel. And if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel. And if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel. And if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel. And if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel. And if you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel. Go Christmroll. Perhaps the Tinkerbell will be of more use for age and knowledge, both of our. Holy shit, he's right there. Don't fuck me. Yes, yes, I'm sorry, Master Tinkerbell. I'm a little bit preoccupied with that mission at hand. I need a Master 2. No, I'm too thrilled about it. I'll get it into the line. That will be our, as opposed to be our cherries. What can you tell us about this machine? I'm sorry. Very well. Don't suppose you know which of character sheets that's not correct. All right, well, does anybody. Very well. Thank you for your. That yes, that will work. Thank you. Are either of you gentlemen good with your hands. Okay, well, I'm thinking. I'm thinking about the first one. And Boatbar is wrong. So I'll let you do it that what you will. Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic. I'm going to be a good guy. Well said, brother, you get the gun. Smooth. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know, I know at least myself and Boatbar have to have protection. I don't know if I like that should be. Thank you. We burn a rubber baby. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're using me in a fucking tank. What is that, Boatbar? Have you ever met a woman friend? She's a very strong fighter. Oh my God. Oh, my God. Oh my gosh. Well, do we think Ireland might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey? I do have very little shrine knowledge, like most of the other dwarves I asked in that garden, red iron box. So yes, let's see what Ireland has to say about the shrine. I mean, so what is he, he's like up the tower is that I'll get out, I'll try to be quick. I'll make my way towards Ireland. So I'll talk to Marblejaw and Paul, Brian and Bill, bring something or other boat varbrestle. This might, you might be the last dwarf to see us alive. They do. Do you know anything? So you know about the shrine then you know it's going out. Can you tell me what would cause a shrine to extinguish? Very well. I'll keep making my way up to you staircase. You know that I'm not that I have not to mind, I'll give it us very little to go off of. So there could have been bandits that took the crystal. I don't know where we would be without this stone. So go with help. So you said Ireland it's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to not regress at this point. Go with Elbrotha. Alright, we'll go back to them. And you all are the may of saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer. Very well back on the back on the room. I will go. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridiron, but yeah, but it has been some time now to live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who is it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we think if we are able to. Yeah. There is an awful lot of them. If we could. I just I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine. Yeah. I'm not going to waste too much time getting to the shrine. Yeah. We have enough range to take another shot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're in the beginning. Okay. Yeah. No, no, that was because I went into my garage to smoke and that's like the fucking. It's that in between area where my phone can't decide to do Wi-Fi or service. So that was. No, I trust me. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be a blood bath. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was well played though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was he like in character? The guy that was playing was he like a. Follow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to play anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it not like what are you falling on? They don't. Is it anything inflated? Oh, nah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's all relatively. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That. Okay. Now I can see it on that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to start jump next. First out of there. Yeah. I have a plus hit, but I didn't get any of the plus damage. So do. Yes, my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yep. Yeah. That's that damage. Yeah. Yeah. Almost did it. Fuck. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. Yeah. I'm sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can try to hit one of them right. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are we going to say if the road's quiet, can we pull over for like hour and a half of the like. Yeah. I think there's like one class or two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tearing gas and zilgen. Right. That's fair. Yeah. Like, will. Yeah. Because right now, assuming our trajectory is around it, right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's your guys. Yeah. So we're going to keep we're going to keep the course. Bring dollars this smart one. Yeah. Well, now we know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's a girl. That works. They're both good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's basically a stone tower obelisk right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I was no great catastrophes, certainly something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warding stone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It has been really hard trying to not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so the end last shrine, the warning stone was housed in the top. So I think we should move. Of the stairs here and see what's become of the previous warning stone. So I think we should move. So I think we should move. Yeah. So trimmer sense is on any solid like stone or like material like stone, but yeah, you can I can sense vibrations. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. Wait, what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Because he's about to lose a nephew. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, both of our I don't know which you did deserve this either. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to kill you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's quad there. Yeah. So at 44. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And is the crystal actor for the same term if it's in turn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I will get get back in the tank and get the fuck out of here. We'll just use turn on dead to drive through the whole world. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in food with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. Yeah. Okay, but double that because it's radiant. Yeah. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. Yeah. I think that's what I think our goal is to create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn is what I think our goal is or my goal is. Yeah. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. So now we just got to drive the drive the thing right. I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",

Don't get me wrong, but there must be some time for respect. How is this possible?  You said both are both are battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of the access.

Very well sentinel shrine before the shrine is going out and I will be accompanied by Thrax's strategy of an nephew.  Is that right?  And this HM, it's a piece of gear. Does it go on?

All right, true to the end of this is how we first bond in Torgoth.  I recall finally.  Thank you.  So something's got something to keep the lights on.  Wait, is the shrine still tomorrows?  No, no, no.  I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you nephew of Thrax's I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp.  More of the same, we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  Over as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, I still putting ale in your mug.  And now you're not even officially started to play the game, man.  You  You  You  You  Probably a morning star.  I think if I did a good job and have like spikes on it, I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded but yeah.  It's a good palette of weapons.  I'm going to miss a smart guy once the war hammer.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  This is my patron saint.  Fucking if he came out, bro, I saw he posted he was like, they're sleeping together, they're cats and everything.  That's  No  You  You  You  You  You  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Interarah, you've been able to set up the  application right?  Press P to your table. What's the important need to do with all of the  things I'm trying to do?  Dan best wants to try out.  Okay.  And, okay.  We'll do this.  I'll give you a little quick.  Can we do that first?  Okay.  I'm gonna stop playing.  Good.  It's the same.  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torega.  That's what you want.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Before we shove off, I'm curious if Bubby has any knowledge of the HM5 or where we're heading.  Bubby, have you not heard when there's sending us?  Can you tell us anything about this HM5?  What about the HM5?  Fantastic.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you, Bubby.  Thank you.  I can we approach the returning slot.  What gave it away?  I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment.

I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment.  Thank you, Bubby.  Very well.  Are you either of you, gentlemen, good with your hands?  Bringo, you said you're pretty sharp mentally.  OK, well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And both of our is strong.  So I'll let you do with that, what you will.  Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic.  I'd both of ours.  Do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You were asking about the weapon earlier.  If you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother, you get the gun.  It's over.  OK.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Oh, sorry.  Good.  Yeah.  I was going to say, I know, I know at least myself and both of our have to have protection.  So I'm going to be able to.  So like as far as defensive spells go like that should be.  We burn a rubber baby.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  I wanna look for spray paint.  As long as the shrine is out the worst get dead we'll get.  Go ahead, Brian.  You  You  Let's say what's what is that bow bar have you ever met a woman friend  Dorgon does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her feminine needs. She's a very strong fighter. I promise  you  You  Oh my god  You  You  Well, do we think our land might be able to offer some important counsel on our journey  And he have this he's you can see us like right so if we if we approach it. Yeah  I'll steer over to see  I do have very little shrine knowledge like most of the other dwarves I asked and that got in red iron box. So yes, let's let's see what Arland has to say about the shrine  You  I mean, so what is he these like up the tower is that  It's all right. We'll turn I'll get out. I'll try to be quick  And I'll make my way towards the George Arland  You  Sherlock marble jaw and  Porgobron and will bring those something or other old bar breathable this might  You might be the last dwarf to see us alive  They do  Do you know anything  So you know you know about the shrine then you know it's going out  When can you tell me what what would cause a shrine to extinguish  As  Very well  I'll keep making my way up to use their case  You  You  You  You  Not that I have not to mind. I'll actually given us very little to go off of I was told it could have been bandits that took the crystal  You  Your secret safe of me Arland but tell me what am I going to do with no warning stone and this is it  I can't complete a mission with no tools  You  You  Thank you Arland you  To have very much  Write in our ship. I don't know where we would be without this stone. So go with help  As you said Arland. It's been a long time of no progress. I only seek to to not regress at this point  Go without brother  All right, we'll go back to live  You  All right y'all  Arland may have saved our asses. I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer  You  Very well back on the back on the room  There we go  You have it  You  It's hard to keep track of time outside of out of the gridter and but  Yes, but it has been some time now to live  See  You  You  Yes, we all love a good beard  And  This is all the game  It's  It is one o'clock somewhere  And flashed it all over the walls  There it is  You  Unfortunately, oh wait, oh shit fuck  Yeah  Oh god, yeah  Oh my god  You  You  You  Oh, who is it  I don't stop the tank  You  They're going to rob us. We need to get to the shrine  You  Ah  You  You  But are you able to get a shot on whatever is approaching us?  All right  You  You  You  You  You  Let's go  Oh, no  You  You  You  So I got this thing is getting no traction. Are you able to put water on it?  You  Very well, all right or I don't bring a cart  The mechanic spot  You  You  I thought he was supposed to be Marga. Oh my god  Oh  Oh  Thank you very much.  You  You  Okay, can you can you can you kind of water those there?  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  So  Can  I got it  Yeah, yeah, that would be it, that would be mine, then.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's do we think if we are able, I'm worried that we'll overheat.  There is an awful lot of them and if we could, I just, I don't want to waste too much time getting to the shrine.  We'll think of face to front and bring it in.  Suppose that is fair, but perhaps we can get a few more shots off before we engage.  We haven't arranged to take another shot.  Thanks for watching.  Thank you.  Thanks.  I like not falling for that.  I'm impressed with your voice and I care.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Can you hear me?  No, I trust you.

I suppose that's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you. nephew of Thraxus. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. More of the same.

Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle, then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. And now you've officially started to play the game, man. You I'm going to go to the next one. Probably a morning star. I think if it didn't, it would probably just be like studded. But yeah. It's a good palette or weapons. Interesting.

I'm curious if Bobby has any knowledge of that age of age. in five or where we're headed. Bobby, have you not heard when there's sending us? There's sending us to this Sentinel pride. It's sad to eat the dead, yes. Somebody does have to light the fire, Bubby. As do you know, can you tell us anything about this age in vibe? I don't know that any of us are very well first in.

We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine at his Benix English. I appreciate your faith that in the faith that I gained from Helm is the only thing keeping one foot in front of another. But we are here, new man and our retinue, a young prodigy, which we will hopefully see his full potential realized. But I need you to let me know what what are we getting into out there? Do you you are operating this thing? Can you tell me the farthest you have gone? We, I have never made a descental shine myself and I know the journey will be long, but any direction would be greatly appreciated. Very well. Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you? I don't know if that they do, but. I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to go ahead and do that.

Can we get back in the fucking tank? you I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. I'm going to turn that blocker off. Sorry. I'll go down first and then if y'all know what to do with it. Okay, so yeah, so me and the mechanic. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. Okay, decent. I can try to hit one of them, right? I'm not going to be a good guy. I'm not going to be a good guy.

I'm going to say if the road's quiet, can we pull over for like an hour and a half in the light? I think there's like one class or two. There's like, yeah. I don't know. Wait, no, I said clear. I have no idea. How it doesn't. Let's go, baby. Oh yeah, that's true. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. Peace. you you you I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tear and gas and zilgen. So, the question then that would tear and gas or zilgen be right? That's fair. I'm sorry. Not that I'm aware it was I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean, yeah, because yeah, you have to ask a very specific question because you can only give a response of like good batter not right like so I do. Yeah, I don't know. you I'm going to we're going to keep the course. I'm going to start the engine. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. you you you I'm last stop boys what do we think? with caution do we want to take the tank all the way to the tower if it seems quiet now? I'm going to you you you you I'm going to it's it's it's basically a stone tower obelisk right that that thing right there I'm I'm on a phone so I can't fucking see that grip. Well you I'm going to be able to do something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warding stone. Let's make our way in. it has been really hard trying to not I've been trying to keep that in mind when I addressed you well so the end last try in the warning stone was housed in the top so I think we should move. I can activate a tremorsense which is on any stone I can sense any movement or of any kind within 60 feet so essentially I want to see what's up there while we're making our way up like with my hand on the wall or something to I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door that is causing vibrations movement sound I will be aware of it. I think it's pretty strong but I that's yeah that's what it does. you you you you you you you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Oh shit. Wait what? you you you you you you I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. you you you you you Thanks so I'm going to have to go to the other side of the door. Alright, here's the previous warning stone is faded. I don't know if anybody can tell if there's foul play. I have not spent much time reading the good word of hell yet. There are lots of right-few young age of level three. So I don't know if anybody else might be more religiously inclined to handle the swap. I don't know if anybody wants to investigate this. I'm not good at that either. I'll hand over the stone. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you What the fuck was that? Fuck! No! Fuck! I'm scared! No, it was somebody do some... I'm scared! What did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Because he's about to lose a nephew. You need to explain yourself. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to roll initiative in one fucking second. You don't start talking. Unfortunately, both of our, I don't know which you did deserve this either. I'm rolling initiative. So, wow. 4. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm going to kill you and remove it from your body. All right. I'm going to kill you. Yeah, I used takeer to weapon to take it from a 5 to a 7. Yes, I do. I'm going to do. Yeah, we'll leave it at that for now. All right. Round three, baby. That's fucking good. So it's 44 damage. And is the cursor locked for the same turn? Yeah. What? No. No. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next one.

I'm going to go to the next one. Dragon Balls now. you Okay. Okay. get to the attack. We just need to get in the vehicle. Let's go. No, yeah, no, no, no. Okay, we knew though there was like a sundering. We knew something happened, but we knew a little bit about like, but no, most of that fuck now. Thank you. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in boot with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. So can I get a swing off one of them? Okay, but double that because it's radiant. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. And so that should create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn. This is what I think our goal is, or my goal is. Okay. I'm going to drive the thing, right? Well, I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. I'm going to throw out the target. I have to back it up. Is it a candle? The fucking double double was insane. It was the triple cross. Once. I told you I told you I could be getting it. I told you to be getting it. You still I'm just such a wonderful. I do like the main on the inside too. It's always a fun to do. Yeah. Is good. Is good. I dug it. But I do. I do. I do got to get ready for my fucking internship GGs.",
