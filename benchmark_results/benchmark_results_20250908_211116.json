I've enjoyed my time out of out of the city it has been enlightening but It is good to see a familiar face, but it's hell out there. We just heard. But we just we've just escaped the else's escape of the lands and I do enjoy the work. Don't get me wrong, but there must be some time for respect. How is this possible? You said boat bar? Boat bar battles. It is a new name to me. Tell me about this nephew of Thraxus. Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but can you explain to me a little bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang? Start with a bad news. Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence and I still can't believe this task. I have some extra memory of the trip into the beyond and I plan to do it again. But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out? And that van does come for the shrine like this before I can't recall having been sent on shrine duty in the past. Very well sentinel shrine the farthest shrine is going out and that will be accompanied by thoraxes. I'll try to do you have an nephew. Is that right? And this hm will it's a it's a piece of gear does it go on? Very well we'll head there post-aiced. Just like every other time they've sent me out I'll keep coming back one way or another. Keep your feet on the ground. Yeah, just please. All right, true to the end of this is how we first bonded. I recall finally. So something's got something to keep the lights on. oh wait, it's a Shones ry's sometime I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but I'm not sure if I can do it. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but it is good to meet you. nephew of Thraxus. I understand you've displayed quite the exceptional skills around the camp. I'm sorry. We spend most of our time outside the walls of the city but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey. As your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind. Here. Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but I'm not sure if I can do it both are but I'm not privy to have you accompany us on this journey. I suppose that's one way to look at it both are but I'm not privy to have you accompany us on this journey. And now you've officially started to play the game man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Was it a bundle? I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I could bro. Treat. I can't. I felt like I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie.

I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I was watching a Christmas movie. I have a plus hit, but I didn't get any of the plus damage. So do. Yes, so my to hit is a plus five with the with the blessing. Yep. Yes, sir. That's that. That's that. Yeah, I'm also going to put a device right on it. I almost did it. Fuck. Yep. It's going to be like a radiant light that kind of like starts in his eyes, flows through. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the engine probably has cooled and I do not want to deal with these arrows anymore. Yeah. I'm going to go turn that blocker off. Sorry. So I guess I'll go I'll go down first and then if y'all know what to do with it. Okay, so yeah, so me and the mechanic. Yeah. Okay, decent. Yeah. Bring it on. Bring it on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can try to hit one of them, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's like one class or two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so right now the path is to avoid tearing gas and zilgen. So is the question then that would tear and gas or zilgen be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would it be possible to find safe passage to tear and gas for us? I don't know. Yeah. Because right now, assuming our trajectory is around it, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to keep the course. Bring dollars this smart one. Yeah. Well, now we know. Yeah. I do. He's a girl. That works. They're both good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's basically a stone tower obelisk road. Yeah. Well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if I was no great catastrophes, certainly something more pointed and directive must have happened to the warning stone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It has been really hard trying to not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so the end last try in the warning stone was housed in the top. So I think we should move. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that it's history. Yeah. Oh, it's. Wait, what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How much for athletics? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, what did your father put you up to? What did your uncle put you up to? For now. Yeah. You need to explain yourself. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, both more. I don't know which you did deserve this either. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to kill you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So at 44. Yeah. And is the crystal actor for the same term if it's in turn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like to imagine I am with my weapon still in food with sacred weapon because I only saw it once after buffing it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but double that because it's radiant. Yeah. So if we start driving, I can use my channel divinity to earn undead within a 30 foot sphere of us. And so that should create enough of a bubble for us to punch through and try to get out of the horn. Yeah. Turn on dead. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So now we just got to drive the drive the thing, right? Yeah. Well, I think I think we just need to focus on getting out of here. So if we have to abandon anything, I think maybe the gunner would be a good choice. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's back to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",

It has been enlightening, but  It is good to see a familiar face, but  There's hell out there  But we just, we've just escaped the el-scape of the lions and I do enjoy the work, don't  get me wrong, but there must be some time for respect.  How is this possible?  You said Bodebar?  Bodebar battles.  It is a new name to me, tell me about this nephew of Thraxus.  Well, then I suppose there are worse babysitters to have, but can you explain to me a little  bit more about why the kernel was taken such an interest in me and my gang?  Let's start with the bad news.  Well, I have to imagine he wouldn't send his nephew if he didn't have some confidence  and that's an us to complete this task, and I'm back from memory of the trip into the  beyond and I plan to do it again.  But can you tell me why do we know why the shrine has gone out?  And that vandals come for these shrines like this before I can't recall having been sent  on shrine duty in the past.  And that will be accompanied by Thraxus' prodigy of an nephew, was that right?  And this hm, it's a piece of gear, does it go on?  Just like every other time they've sent me out, I'll keep coming back.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Our hatred of the undead is how we first bond in Torgoth.  I recall finally.  Thank you.  Something's got to keep the lights on.  Wait, is it sure I'm still tomorrows?  I suppose that's one way.  That's one way to look at it both are, but it is good to meet you nephew of Thraxus.  More of the same, we spend most of our time outside the walls of the city, but I would be glad to have you accompany us on this journey.  But as your uncle shared with you any more details of the mission I've only recently called wind.  Well, if you don't have any information that I'm not privy to perhaps from your uncle then I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.  Bobby, I still putting ale in your mug.  And now you're not even officially started to play the game man.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Probably a morning star.  I think if I did a good job and have like spikes on it, I think if it didn't it would probably just be like studded but yeah.  That's a good pallet or weapons.  I'm just a smart guy once the war hammer.  Hey.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  This is my patron saint.  Fucking if he came out, bro, I saw he posted he was like they're sleeping together the cats and everything.  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  I don't know.  We'll see you next time.  You  Like any good man of the cloth filled with shame. That's why I like you, Torga.  You  You  You  You  You  Before we shove off, I'm curious if booby has any knowledge of that hm five or where we're headed.  Are you not heard when they're sending us?  They're sending us to this Sentinel pride.  It's sadly dated. Yes.  You  Somebody does have to light the fire, booby.  As do you know, can you tell us anything about this agent vibe?  I don't know that any of us are very well first in.  Okay.  And then.  But it went about the HM5, the one that we're taking.  Fantastic. No further questions. Thank you, Bobby.  You  You  Turgers are women she doesn't understand for just fine.  But they do now, but they do now.  You look beautiful, get in the fucking divinity tanker, let's go.  I can we approach the returning slot.  What gave it away?  It's good to meet you as well, Brainer. Hopefully it will not be the last time.  I don't know if you've heard about our team's recent assignment, but  in Helm's name, we must.  We have to go to the Sentinel Thrine, it has been extinguished.  I appreciate your faith, that in the faith that I gained from Helm is the only thing  keeping one foot in front of another.  But we are here, we have a new man in our retinue, a young prodigy,  which we will hopefully see his full potential realized.  But I need you to let me know, what are we getting into out there?  Do you have, you are operating this thing?  Can you tell me the farthest you have gone?  I have never made a Sentinel shine myself, and I know the journey will be long,  but any direction would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much.  Very well.  Anybody else, would you mind if any of our team has any other burning questions for you?  I don't know if that they do, but.  Thank you very much.  Well brain warrior, your intel has been very valuable, I hope to put it to good use.  Keep your feet on the ground.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Perhaps the tinkerer will be of more use for age and knowledge, both of our.  Holy shit, he's right there.  What the fuck, man?  Yes, yes, I'm sorry, master tinker, I'm a little bit preoccupied with the mission at hand,  but I'm not too thrilled about it, but.  I'll get it into the line, brother.  There's sending us to a Sentinel hill.  That will be our, as supposed to be our serious, what can you tell us about this machine?  Very well.  I don't suppose you know which of character sheet stats knows.  Well, does anybody.  Very well, thank you for your.  That yes, that will work.  Are either of you gentlemen good with your hands.  Bringo, you, you said you're pretty sharp mentally, yeah.  Well, I'm thinking, Bringo, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.  And boat bar is strong, so I'll let you do with that what you will.  Perhaps you would be a good fit for the mechanic.  And boat bar, do you feel more suited to drive or to shoot?  You were asking about the weapon earlier, if you have the gusto for the weapon, I won't deprive you of it.  Well said, brother, you get the gun.  Move on.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  I know, I know at least myself in the boat bar have to have protection from Britain able to.  Oh.  We burn a rubber, baby.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, Bringo.  All right.  All right.  What is that boat bar?  I don't know.  The organ does best on the battlefield when she doesn't have to worry about her.  Her feminine needs.  She's a very strong fighter.  I promise.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh my gosh.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'll steer over to see.  I do have very little shrine knowledge, like most of the other dwarves I asked in that goddamn red iron box.  So yes, let's, let's see what Arlen has to say about the shrine.  All right.  I mean, so what is he these like up the tower is that.  I'll get out.  I'll try to be quick.  I'll make my way towards the George Arlen.  I'll try to be quick.  Turlock, marble jaw and.  Porego, Bron and will bring those something or other boat bar brothel.  This might.  You might be the last dwarf to see us alive.  Do.  Do you know anything.  So you know what you know about the shrine then.  You know it's going out.  I mean, can you tell me what what would cause a shrine to extinguish.  Very well.  I'll keep making my way up to the staircase.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Not that I have not to mind.  I was told it could have been bandits that took the crystal.  Your secret safe of me, Arlen.  But tell me what am I going to do with no warning stone and this is it.  I can't complete a mission with no tools.  Thank you, Arlen.  You have very much right in our ship.  I don't know where we would be without this stone.  So go with help.  As you said, Arlen, it's been a long time of no progress.  I only seek to to not regress at this point.  Go with elm brother.  All right, we'll go back to live.  Arlen may have saved our asses.  I have a warning stone and I think this might not be a death march any longer.  Very well back on the room.  There we go.  Thank you.  It's hard to keep track of time outside of the gridter, but it has been some time now to live.  See.  Thank you.  Yes, yes, we all love a good beer.  Thank you, Arlen.  Thank you, Arlen.  Thank you, Arlen.  Thank you, Arlen.  Thank you, Arlen.  Thank you.  Thank you, Arlen.  Who is it?  Arlen.  I don't stop the tank.  They're going to rob us.  We need to get to this ride.  Arlen.
